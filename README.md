1, Run react-compelte-guide, open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. 
2, Run node server.js in folder src, and open http://localhost:8000/customers in your browser. 
3, Login in http://localhost:3000/ 
Currently I only create two users:  
        Customer User: ID: 2       Password: 654321
        Store User: ID: 1          Password: 123456

Next plan: 1, Authentication for login. 2, Make the UI more user-friendly.
